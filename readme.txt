Installation:
1. Install CameraScroll.dll as a normal partiality mod. Publicity Stunt is also required.
2. Copy the Regions folder and merge it with the existing Regions folder in Rain World\World.
3. To disable it, just disable the partiality mod. The extra files will have no effect on the regular game.

Known bugs:
1. Right now, Rusty Machine is not compatible with Publicity Stunt, and this mod requires Publicity Stunt, so it cannot be used with Rusty Machine until it is fixed. This is not our problem and we can not help you with it, other than "don't use rusty machine and camera scroll together" or "try updating rusty machine".
2. The put-together room cameras are put together before the game runs, so custom regions will break in an interesting way.

If the game crashes with the mod enabled, or you see black bars at the edge of the screen when you shouldn't, ping @pastebin.com/q3BTYZc9#2330 in #modding-support in the Rain World discord, upload the exception log if there is one and tell us about any other mods you have enabled.
